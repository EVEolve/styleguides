# Style Guides

This repository contains style guides for various programming languages used in
EVEolve projects. When contributing to one of the EVEolve repositories, please
make sure the code reasonably conforms to these guidelines. We take the stance
that style guides aren't an ultimate authority, they're recommendations. If a
technical issue, precedent in the project, or just plain common sense gives you
good reason to deviate from the guidelines at times, that's ok. Use your best
judgement.

If there is a conflict between these guidelines and existing code in a project,
try to follow the style of the project. It's more important that the project
presents itself as a consistent piece of work. Most likely this won't be visible
as a written style guide for the project, but in the majority of code already
written.
